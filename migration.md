Here‚Äôs a clean bullet list of what we‚Äôve done so far ‚úÖ

* **Defined a migration process** for strategies to match the standardized structure used in `ichimoku.py`.
* **Generalized the migration prompt** so the same process applies to *all strategies* (fusion, ml, smc, technical).
* **Added checklist system**: AI should maintain a list of migrated files and verify none are missed.
* **Updated strategy list** from your latest project tree (`src/strategies/`) to ensure accuracy.
* **Marked `ichimoku.py` and `harmonic.py` as already migrated** and specified they should be used as reference templates.
* **Wrote a unified migration prompt** with the correct, updated strategy list.
* **Generated a Python orchestrator script (`run_all_strategies.py`)** that:

  * Runs all strategies dynamically.
  * Executes them in both **mock** and **live** modes.
  * Collects results (`signals`, `analysis`, `performance`).
  * Saves everything in a structured text file (`strategy_run_results.txt`) at project root.

Got it üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs a structured breakdown with **main bullets** (overall progress) and **sub-bullets** (what exactly we did inside the migration work):

### ‚úÖ Overall Progress

* Defined and documented the **migration process** for strategies.
* Generalized the migration prompt to cover all strategies.
* Updated the strategy list from your latest repo tree.
* Marked `ichimoku.py` and `harmonic.py` as **already migrated reference files**.
* Created a **checklist system** for tracking migrations.
* Built a **runner script (`run_all_strategies.py`)** to test all strategies in both modes and save structured results.

### üîÑ Migration Work (Details)

* **Imports & sys.path fixes**

  * Replaced ad-hoc `sys.path` manipulation with a clean, standardized snippet using `Path`.
  * Centralized imports:

    * `AbstractStrategy`, `Signal`, `SignalType`, `SignalGrade` from `src.core.base`.
    * `parse_mode`, `print_mode_banner` from `src.utils.cli_args`, with safe fallback stubs.
  * Removed leftover debug prints (like `print(sys.path)`).

* **Live/Mock switching logic**

  * Inside `__init__`:

    * Read mode from config + CLI overrides.
    * Printed a banner for current mode.
    * If live: attempted to connect `MT5Manager` (with fallback to mock if it fails).
    * If mock/unavailable: created mock MT5 using `_create_mock_mt5()`.
  * `_create_mock_mt5()` built fake OHLCV DataFrame with slight variations for mock vs live.

* **Standardized test harness** (at bottom of each file)

  * Added `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
  * Created a simple `test_config`.
  * Initialized strategy with mode-aware MT5 manager.
  * Printed mode banner.
  * Ran and displayed results for:

    1. Signal generation.
    2. Analysis (a few indicator values).
    3. Performance summary.

* **Preserved strategy-specific logic**

  * Did **not** touch the math, indicators, or core trading logic.
  * Only wrapped them in standardized imports, mode handling, and test harness.
